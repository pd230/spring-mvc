# Spring MVC Practice Project

This is a **learning-oriented Spring MVC web application** built as a part of my Java development practice. The current focus is on understanding project configuration, Spring XML setup, and implementing core modules like user login.

---

## 📌 Project Status

✅ Working Spring MVC Project Setup  
✅ Basic Login Module Implemented  
✅ `error_details.txt` file maintained with troubleshooting history  
🔜 Upcoming Features: Registration, Session Handling, Dashboard, Form Validation

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Java 17+**
- **Spring MVC 6.2.7**
- **Eclipse IDE 2023-12**
- **Jakarta Servlet & JSP API**
- **Apache Tomcat 10.x**
- **JSTL / HTML / CSS (for frontend)**

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Clone this repository** or download the ZIP.
2. **Import into Eclipse** as an existing dynamic web project.
3. Ensure **Tomcat 10** is configured in Eclipse.
4. Right-click the project → Run on Server.
5. Navigate to: `http://localhost:8080/SpringMVCPractice/login`

## 🔐 Features So Far

### ✅ Login Module
- Accepts username and password
- Validates against hardcoded or dummy values (for now)
- Redirects to a welcome page (or shows error on failure)

---

## 🐞 error_details.txt

All setup issues, XML schema errors, dependency conflicts, and resolution steps have been documented in the `error_details.txt` file. This helps track issues faced during the Spring configuration process.

---

## 💡 Purpose

This project is a **personal sandbox** to:
- Practice core Spring MVC concepts
- Learn project setup from scratch
- Debug real-time issues and document them
- Gradually build a mini full-stack application

---

## 📅 Upcoming Plan

- Add registration form with backend logic  
- Integrate JDBC or Hibernate for DB connectivity  
- Apply form validation (Spring’s `@Valid`)  
- Add logout and session management  
- Styling with Bootstrap
